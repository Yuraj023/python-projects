# 🐍 Python Practice Repository

## 📌 About

This repository contains my Python projects and practice programs that I built while learning Python.  
I believe in learning by doing, so each project here represents hands-on implementation of concepts rather than just theory.

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Strengthen core Python fundamentals
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Build practical understanding of real-world logic
- Prepare for internships and developer roles
